# dlp-ui
An easy-to-use UI for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

Allows the user to easily download audio or video.  
Requires python3 and pip to run.

## Usage
The application can be ran with `python3 D:\Projects\yt-dl\main.py` in the commandline.  
This command can be put in something like a .bat file for easy booting. 

Upon first time running, you will be asked to select directories for the application to save its output.  
These settings can later be changed in the options menu, or in the `config.json` file that gets generated under root.

The music and video output of this application are in .mp3 and .mp4 format respectively.
